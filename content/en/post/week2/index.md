The final goal of this project is to create a personal website using Hugo and wowchemy academic template.

### Task of this week

Add personal information.

### The working process

First add your picture to `admin` folder and change education information in `_index.md`.

Then change Biography, Interests and Education sections.

After changing personal information create a new post. I chose the topic "Git".

Make sure to add tags and authors sections.

Open the site to check if everything works fine.
